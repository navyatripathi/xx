Task Breakdown
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The first step in the project involved exploring the dataset to understand the data distribution, relationships, and important features.

EDA.ipynb: This notebook includes:
Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Summary statistics and visualizations of key features.
Analysis of transactions, customer profiles, and product categories.
2. Lookalike Model
The second task involved creating a lookalike model that recommends similar customers based on transaction and product information.

Lookalike.ipynb: In this notebook:
We combined transaction data with customer information.
A similarity score was calculated using transaction history and profiles.
A recommendation system was built to suggest 3 lookalike customers for each of the first 20 customers.
Lookalike.csv: This CSV file contains the lookalike recommendations, including the customer IDs and their corresponding similarity scores.
3. Customer Segmentation / Clustering
In the final task, customer segmentation was performed using clustering algorithms to group customers based on their transaction behavior and profiles.

Clustering.ipynb: This notebook involves:
Data preprocessing and feature selection.
Applying the DBSCAN clustering algorithm to segment customers into meaningful groups.
Evaluation of the clusters using metrics such as DB Index and Silhouette Score.
Clustering.pdf: A detailed report of the clustering results, including:
Number of clusters formed.
DB Index value and other relevant clustering metrics.
Visual representation of the clusters and insights.
Data Description
Customers.csv

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
CustomerName: Name of the customer.
Region: The region where the customer resides.
SignupDate: Date when the customer signed up.
Products.csv

ProductID: Unique identifier for each product.
ProductName: Name of the product.
Category: Product category.
Price: Price of the product.
Transactions.csv

TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction.
ProductID: ID of the product sold.
TransactionDate: Date of the transaction.
Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased.
TotalValue: Total value of the transaction.
Price: Price of the product.
Methods Used
Clustering Algorithms:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) was chosen for customer segmentation as it does not require a pre-defined number of clusters and handles noise (outliers) effectively.
Lookalike Model:

Similarity scores were computed based on total spend, quantity, and average price.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used for finding the closest similar customers.
Evaluation Metrics:

DB Index and Silhouette Score were calculated to evaluate the quality of clustering.
Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to evaluate the lookalike model recommendations.

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
2. Running the Notebooks
Clone the repository or download the project folder.
Open FirstName_LastName_EDA.ipynb in Jupyter or Google Colab and run each cell to perform the exploratory data analysis.
Proceed with FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.ipynb to generate lookalike recommendations.
Finally, run FirstName_LastName_Clustering.ipynb to perform customer segmentation and visualize the clusters.
3. Output
The final output of the clustering task is saved in FirstName_LastName_Clustering.pdf.
Lookalike recommendations are saved in FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv.
Results
Clustering Task: The DBSCAN algorithm formed meaningful clusters based on customer transaction history, with an evaluation of clustering metrics (DB Index, Silhouette Score). Visualizations show the distribution of customers across clusters.
Lookalike Task: The lookalike model successfully recommended the top 3 similar customers for each of the first 20 customers based on their purchase behavior.
Future Work
Experiment with other clustering algorithms like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to compare the results.
Incorporate additional features like the recency of purchases or product categories for better segmentation.
Fine-tune the lookalike model using different similarity measures or advanced techniques like collaborative filtering.
